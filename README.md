## Project Description
This project focuses on downscaling nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations from coarse-resolution satellite data to fine-resolution maps using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and visualization. The study also analyzes feature importance and compares model performance with existing approaches.

## Key Features
- Machine learning-based NO₂ downscaling pipeline
- Analysis of feature importance for model interpretation
- Visualizations including maps, charts, and histograms
- Comparison with previous research and methods
- Practical implications for urban air quality monitoring
